##### The Trials and Tribulations of Building Your Own CTF and Shooting Gallery - BSidesPDX

<p class="tab">It is said that “the best defense is a good offense” which means organizations and defenders need to think offensively in order to detect and evade threats. A good method for instilling an offensive mindset into defenders is to place them in offensive scenarios. This is where the CTF and Shooting Gallery concepts comes into play. By creating an internal shooting gallery in your organization, you can have an isolated playground for anyone to practice offensive security techniques. Furthermore, Capture The Flag (CTF) events are becoming increasingly popular at security conferences and inside of organizations. Unfortunately, there is a barrier of entry for those that have never played CTF before and occasionally individuals feel overwhelmed with all there is to know about participating, creating or hosting one. Over the last 2 years Topher has put together several CTF events - each being hosted in a drastically different way. This talk will cover the basics of building a shooting gallery, CTF challenges along with hosting and deploying them in order to increase organizational effectiveness and knowledge.</p>

##### [Trusted Platform Modules and Their Applicability to Hardware and Software Security Mitigations - IEEE HOST](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/host/2017/3929/00/07951728.pdf)

<p class="tab">This tutorial seeks to showcase the use of Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) and Trusted Execution Environments
(TEE) as they pertain to providing isolated security environments and metrics usable by every major component of a
platform. Hardware security implementations, modern operating systems including some of their software and
firmware utilize measurements from TPMs to ensure the reliability of platforms. We will discuss Intel technologies
such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and how it uses TPMs to measure platform components. We will
also showcase how BIOS platforms utilize TPMs to ensure the SPI flash has not been tampered with and explain
Intel boot guard technology. Furthermore, modern operating systems have dependencies on TPMs and we will
discuss how Windows 10 uses them to ensure Virtualization Based Security (VBS) has not been tampered with.
Lastly we will also discuss modern TEEs such as ARM TrustZone, and Intel SGX and how those can be used to
provide secure code isolation. We will engage with the audience to showcase the usage of TPMs and TEEs by going
over their history, their applicability and showing how both are used in hardware, platform firmware and on
operating system security features. </p>

### 2019

##### [Attack Infrastructure for the Modern Red-Team - CanSecWest](https://cansecwest.com/speakers.html)

<p class="tab">While active hacking is the sexy part of red teaming, everybody knows that there is a lot of unsexy prep work prior to an engagement. A robust attack infrastructure is a complicated, yet critical, part of that prep work. . As Red Teams continue to grow in maturity, a successful engagement relies on infrastructure that is suitable for covert activities such as attack modeling and adversarial emulation while also being suitable for overt games. High quality attacks require high quality infrastructure. A single opsec failure could set an operation back days or even weeks, and in some cases might result in having to scrap the op entirely (or worse). Needing a repeatable, modular, auditable, secure and automatic infrastructure for Red Team engagements, the authors have created an easy to use deployment system with recipes so you, too, can have robustness without being tied down by deployment readiness! This presentation will provide all the tooling and automation to make these deployments simple and repeatable. Your Red Team will now be able to deploy infrastructure per engagement, providing you with opsec safety to keep your engagement rolling before the blue team hunts you down. Learn it, love it, live it.</p>

##### EDR Is Coming; Hide Yo Sh!t - [DEF CON 27](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-27/dc-27-speakers.html#Leibowitz) / ToorCon 21

<p class="tab">There’s a new, largely unaddressed threat in the security industry today, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), which aims to stop threat actors in their tracks. The scenario plays out like this... At first your campaign is going well and your attacker objectives are being met. Then, your lovingly crafted payloads become analyst samples, you’re evicted from the environment and you lose your persistence. You and the analyst are now having a bad time. You may feel this is just fear mongering, but we assure you, the risk is real.Fortunately, we have a few new tricks up our sleeves to keep this nightmare scenario at bay. While many would have you believe that we live in a measured and signed boot Utopia on modern systems, we will show you the seedy underbelly of this Brave New World. By abusing early boot mechanisms and UEFI platform firmware, we are able to evade common detection. By showing up early to the fight, we sucker punch EDR, leaving it in a daze unable to see our malicious activities. We put a new twist on old code injection techniques and maintain persistence in UEFI firmware, making an effective invisibility cloak. By leveraging these two techniques, you and the analyst can have a happy and relaxing evening. From that point on - the good ol’ days are back again! Plunder away!</p>

### 2023

##### When EDR Is Stupid; You Don't Need to be Smart - HushCon / Red Team Summit

<p class="tab">The majority of Red Teams are now going up against Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tooling which aims to stop threat actors in their tracks. The scenario plays out like this... At first your engagement is going well and your attacker objectives are being met. Then, your lovingly crafted payloads become analyst samples, you’re evicted from the environment and you lose your persistence. You and the analyst are now having a bad time.</p>

<p class="tab">What if I told you there were numerous ways that EDR is significantly lacking and you don't need to worry about it? Having looked at several EDR platforms in the last year, many succumb to the same limitations, lack of detective capability, and blatantly ignore off the shelf TTPs! In this talk I will go over several ways that EDR completely falls apart, how to bypass it, and how you can avoid your payload becoming an analysts sample.</p>

### 2024

##### Red Team Infrastructure Panel (Panelist) - Red Team Summit

Attendees will leave with valuable insights and practical knowledge to enhance their organizations' red team operations.</p>

##### Keeping the Red Team Mission on Track Panel (Panel Moderator) - Red Team Summit

<p class="tab">Institutionalization is the antithesis of Red Teaming - a Red Team needs to be able to conduct their mission without being swallowed whole by the organization. This panel will discuss how Red Teams across the cabal keep their mission, or fail to keep it, on track with an ever growing list of demands from an organization. All Red Teams are at the behest of their organization and their organizations needs/demands, but often times a Red Team needs to be enabled to choose their own path for engagements and workload.  Panelists will share their experiences leading Red Teams and how they handle balancing business demand against the team choosing their adventure.</p>

### 2025

##### Turning Sh*t Burgers into Gold Nuggets - Red Team Summit

<p class="tab">What do you do when your executive leadership comes to your team and asks you to do what seems like an impossible task, in a tight timeframe, or a task that is not necessarily within your teams limited, but always expanding scope? Well, you say yes of course, and you eat that burger. It happens all at once, the layers of crud just keep piling on up, and you're just gonna have to eat it. While Sh!t Burgers may seem like a curse, they often have tremendous value for the organization. 

This talk will discuss the dynamic between Red Teams and organizational priorities, and discuss engagements that shed light on how a Red Team can be impactful after organizational shifts, while telling the story of empowerment, change in ICs mindsets as a result of listening, and being a force for change.</p>
