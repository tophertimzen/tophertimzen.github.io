## Introduction

Over the weekend of October 26th and 27st I ran the [BSidesPDX](https://twitter.com/bsidespdx) CTF for the third year with an amazing team consisting of [fdcarl](https://twitter.com/fdcarl), [aagallag](https://twitter.com/aagallag), [dade](https://twitter.com/0xdade), and [arinerron](https://twitter.com/arinerron) with infrastructure supported by [Mozilla](https://twitter.com/mozilla). We decided to run all of the challenges in Docker containers in Amazon Web Services (AWS) k8s again this year using the deployment framework from our [2017 CTF](https://github.com/BSidesPDX/CTF-2017). 

This post will detail some of our decisions, the results and improvement areas. 

## Challenges

For the 2018 CTF we had 12 challenges across 4 domains

- Web Exploitation

- Binary exploitation / Reverse Engineering

- OSINT

- Forensics

OSINT and Forensics challenges were new to BSidesPDX this year. During the post mortem of BSidesPDX 2017, it was mentioned that our CTF was only offensive security focused and had no defense challenges. Given I am a huge proponent for cross training, I decided to enlist [arinerron](https://twitter.com/arinerron) to write 3 forensics challenges for us. 

OSINT was also added as [dade](https://twitter.com/0xdade) has a passion for it and given we had added the OSINT CTF from Trace Labs (a writeup from them is available [here](https://www.tracelabs.org/2018/10/bsides-portland-2018-event-debrief/)) we felt it necessary to include some CTF challenges in this category. The OSINT CTF made use of LinkedIn, GitHub and a custom website.

[fdcarl](https://twitter.com/fdcarl) would up writing the web challenges and [aagallag](https://twitter.com/aagallag) the two binary exploitation challenges. 

Our concepts at a higher level are available [here](https://github.com/BSidesPDX/CTF-2018/blob/master/concepts.txt) and all of the source code for them is located at their respective category and level on the repo [here](https://github.com/BSidesPDX/CTF-2018). All challenges have solutions and can be deployed with docker-compose. 

The challenges were meant to target beginner/intermediate players and I feel did a sufficient job of that. We had people in the event room that had never played a CTF before solving challenges and catting flags (in fact, 8 people came up on stage during closing ceremonies to collect a beer mug for their accomplishment)

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure was once again hosted by [Mozilla](https://twitter.com/mozilla) with Daniel Hartnell doing all of our orchestration. A shout out to Jeff Bryner and Andrew Krug are necessary as well as they helped provide the monetary resources and getting me in touch with Daniel. 

We once again used our 2017 framework to deploy docker containers to a kubernetes environment that utilized

- Kubernetes in AWS via Amazon EKS
- Network policies to restrict pod network access
- kube2iam to provide restricted IAM roles to pods
- Disabled ServiceAccount token mount inside pods
- RBAC enabled

## Scoreboard

Having used it in the past, going with [CTFd](https://twitter.com/ctfdio) was a no brainier. It is easy to deploy and administer. We hosted our scoreboard at [BSidesPDXCTF.party](https://bsidespdxctf.party/). We also did this for 2017 and this paragraph was copy/pasted! 

## Results

This year we had 

89 teams register (up from 62 in 2017)

26 teams solved challenges (double than last year which had 13 teams ! ! !)

Most solved: Leaky Secrets has the most solves with 19 solves

Least solved: Hidden with 1 solve

Solved breakdown

- 19 Leaky Secrets

- 12 Death by 1000 Curls

- 12 Leaky Security 

- 8 Leaky Projects

- 3 secureshell

- 3 Trollsec

- 3 mic

- 3 capture

- 2 goxor

- 2 Dodona

- 2 pwnclub

- 1 hidden

People liked solving the OSINT challenges!

It is also worth stating that this year EVERY challenge was solved at least once! The 2017 CTF had some overly difficult challenges that were never solved and we reevaluated the difficulty of challenges for this event. 

Final Scoreboard:

```

## What To do Better / Different

Live scoreboard: We did not even think of having a live pew pew scoreboard during the CTF in the event room.... our mistake. we will be better. 

OSINT 200 had the most solves of the entire event with 19 teams solving it. We are thinking of using [Dynamic Value Challenge](https://github.com/CTFd/DynamicValueChallenge) next year to reduce the amount of points a challenge has if it is solved frequently. 

## Get Involved!

If you want to help us run BSidesPDX CTF in anyway please reach out to me! We are eager to get some people stoked on writing challenges to make 2019 even better. The idea behind a base reference implementation is that the challenge creation comes to the foreground much easier and can be focused on without worrying about much else!


## Thanks 

I want to extend another huge thanks to
